Project Name: Syntactical

Description: This game challenges users to use sentence-structure clues to guess missing words in a sentence. Users have 5 guesses to fill in the blanks correctly. Users can guess 3, 4, and 5-letter words. 
Each time a user guesses, the on-screen keyboards indicates whether the letters in the user's guessed are correctly placed.
